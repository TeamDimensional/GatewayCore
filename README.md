## Gateway Core

This mod includes various features used in Dimension Gateway that could not be made through Groovyscript.

### List of features

* JEI compatibility for Flower Growth ritual from Roots.
* A reworked set of TConstruct's materials and traits (many of them are stackable, some materials have multiple, etc.)
* A fix to the Tinker's Construct book not showing materials without a head part.
* JEI compatibility for CoFH World.
  * This only implements the generators I use in the pack, but other generators can be easily added in. 

## Credits

* Tinker's Construct devs (I borrowed some code/assets from their code base)
